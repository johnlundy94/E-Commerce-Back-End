# E-Commerce-Backend

## Description

My motivation in creating this app was to utilize a complete backend to house information pertaining to a companies products.
I built this project so that companies might be able to keep better organized.
If a company is just starting out or are expanding their product lines rapidly there problem of knowing exactly what is in their stock would be solved.
I learned how to incorporate a backend using node.js, MySQL and sequelize.
